# Productivity UI – Clean Interfaces, My Way

This project is all about exploring clean and functional UI designs for productivity apps.  
Whether it's a task manager, a daily dashboard, or a simple notes panel, each version here is a different take on what a solid productivity interface could look like — all built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

### 💡 Why I Made This

I wanted to level up my front-end design skills by building real, usable layouts — the kind you'd actually want to interact with.  
Instead of just one version, I made several, so I could tweak things like:

- Layout spacing and structure  
- Button and input styling  
- How everything feels visually (fonts, color, alignment)  
- Interactive elements using JavaScript

### 🛠️ Tech Used

- **HTML** – structure  
- **CSS** – design and responsiveness  
- **JavaScript** – added behavior and interactions

This isn’t meant to be a polished app — it’s a playground where I try new ideas and improve version by version.  
Thanks for checking it out!
